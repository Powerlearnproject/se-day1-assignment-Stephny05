Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is an engineering principle, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.introduction to structured 
2. advent to object-oriented 
3. Rise of Agile methodologies 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. planning: it involves feasibility studies and risk evaluation to obtain project viability 
2. requirements analysis: it involves gathering requirements from stakeholders
3. design:it involves the software architect outlining the basic requirements
4. coding
5. testing 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall is a linear and sequential approach.it basically allows step by step 
while agile is iterative and incremental approach, it gives options for revisiting.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer designs, implement and maintain a software application 
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
they both enhance productivity,code quality and collaboration.
example of IDEs-pluggins and extension, debugging tools 
example of VCS - pull request and safe recovery 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Requirements do change due to evolving clients request and it could lead product delay or complexity..
possible solutions to this is to emplore the use of agiles methodologies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing:it helps to ensure that the individual components of the software works perfectly.
integration testing:it issues related interface and data flows between the modules.
system testing:it helps the entire system function in the real world scenario.
Acceptance testing:it validates if the systems are ready for deployment 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and refining prompts-inputs,text or instructions to guide an AI model.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Does a programmer program".
"Who is a programmer ".
in asking an AI model your has to be precise and specific this makes more effects on how your answers will be generated.
